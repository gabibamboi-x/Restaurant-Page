## Lessons Learned

The hardest part making this project was designing it. Coming up with new designs on new projects is always a challange for me, it is however not imposible and so i kept going. A second challange was webpack which was a new way to develop a website for me as a beginner, though i'm starting to like it. npm and the 'watch', 'serve' scripts were also something i see myself using quite often in the future.
